Create a Wi-Fi hotspot that shares the internet connection from the ethernet cable. That’s it.

What will we need ?
I stumbled accros create_ap a few weeks ago. It’s simple, easy to use and it WORKS magi-perfectly. It has a lot of little hacks that addresses some of known issues with some adapters and wifi modes.

Steps
1. Install required packages and create_ap

sudo yum install haveged iw hostapd
sudo cd /var/opt ; sudo git clone https://github.com/oblique/create_ap
sudo cd create_ap ; sudo make install
 
sudo yum install haveged iw hostapd
sudo cd /var/opt ; sudo git clone https://github.com/oblique/create_ap
sudo cd create_ap ; sudo make install
2. Get your network cards information and test
Since CentOS 7 uses a different naming convention for the network cards, find the label of your card by typing


ip a

Once you get them, test create_ap :


create_ap wlp3s0 enp2s0 MyAccessPoint MyPassPhrase

all done ur wifi name is MyAccessPoint and ur wifi password is MyPassPhrase
